# Personal Project Creator #

## Description ##


This is a simple C# project (thrown together do not judge code base). 
I needed something for my streamdeck and thought why not create a project creator app. 
So I can quickly make projects without having to launch VS  or VS Code and go through the wizard. 
Also be able to support multiple languages and projects I create often.

This code is aimed to support all the little projects I create and write often. 
You are more than welcome to fork it and make what you want out of it.

THIS CODE COMES WITH 0 License / Responsibility on Me. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

Thanks,
Mike

### Notes: ###

Keep in mind that for PHP projects the code checks Environment Variables that PHP is installed and Composer is installed.

If you use WSL or other methods for your projects and only require PHP and Composer there. You may need to modify code
